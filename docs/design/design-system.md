# kuyara design system

## Status and relationship to the visual identity

This document is the implementation reference for kuyara's semantic design-token foundation and small adaptive UI primitive layer. The approved brand decisions remain canonical in [`visual-identity.md`](visual-identity.md). The implementation supports the application shell and near-term MVP presentation without defining final product screens or a broad component library.

Tokens and theme resolution live in `apps/mobile/src/theme/`; the shared primitive layer lives in `apps/mobile/src/components/ui/`. Primitive values feed authored semantic light and dark colors, which feed a typed application theme and shared presentation components:

## Primitive and semantic colors

`brandColors` records the six approved palette values once: `deepAtmosphere`, `calmCurrent`, `quietSky`, `softMist`, `nightLayer`, and `cloudWhite`. Presentation code must not import or consume these primitive names. They are inputs to semantic roles, not UI instructions.

Both appearances expose the same semantic roles:

- Foundations: `background`, `backgroundElevated`, `surface`, `surfaceMuted`, `surfaceInteractive`
- Content: `textPrimary`, `textSecondary`, `textOnBrand`, `iconPrimary`, `iconSecondary`
- Identity and interaction: `brandPrimary`, `brandAccent`, `focusRing`
- Boundaries and overlays: `borderSubtle`, `borderStrong`, `scrim`

The light and dark sets are authored independently. Dark appearance is not an inversion. Light appearance uses Soft Mist as the page foundation, Cloud White for elevated content, and Deep Atmosphere for primary content and controls. Dark appearance uses Night Layer as the page foundation, Deep Atmosphere for elevated content, Cloud White for primary content, and Quiet Sky for secondary content, focus, and primary controls. A few restrained tonal surface and border values extend the approved palette for hierarchy; they are semantic UI values, not additional brand colors.

Status roles are intentionally deferred until the app has concrete informational, success, warning, and error presentation. Adding indistinguishable or unused status colors now would be speculative. Future status UI must not communicate state by color alone.

### Contrast evidence

Contrast was calculated with the WCAG relative-luminance formula. The measurements are evidence for these important pairs, not a claim that the complete application is formally WCAG conformant:

| Pair | Light | Dark |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Primary text on background | 12.90:1 | 16.09:1 |
| Secondary text on background | 6.52:1 | 10.03:1 |
| Text on brand-primary control | 12.61:1 | 10.03:1 |
| Focus ring on background | 6.52:1 | 10.03:1 |
| Primary text on the weather card | 11.51:1 | 13.80:1 |
| Eyebrow and accent text on the weather card | 5.81:1 | 8.61:1 |
| Accent-filled pill label on its fill | 6.37:1 | 10.03:1 |
| Photo placeholder label on its tint | 5.95:1 | 7.04:1 |
| Muted rain bar against the weather card | 3.15:1 | 4.97:1 |

The first four rows are text pairs measured against the 4.5:1 threshold. The last row is meaningful non-text content measured against the 3:1 threshold; rain probability is additionally encoded by bar height and repeated in the group's accessibility label, so it never depends on color alone. The weather card tint is `brandAccent` at 0.08 over `background`, and the photo placeholder tint is `brandAccent` at 0.05 over `surface`. These pairs are asserted in `theme.test.mjs`.

## Scales

Spacing follows a restrained four-point rhythm: `xs` 4, `sm` 8, `md` 12, `lg` 16, `xl` 24, and `2xl` 32. The separate `minimumTouchTarget` layout value is 44 points; it is not treated as spacing.

Typography uses platform system fonts and the semantic roles `display`, `titleLarge`, `title`, `eyebrow`, `body`, `bodyStrong`, `caption`, `label`, and `code`. The `code` role selects the platform system monospace face. The `eyebrow` role is a small uppercase letter-spaced label used above a value or a grouped block, currently by the Today weather card's metric and rain-timeline headings; it carries no color of its own and is normally paired with the `textSecondary` role. React Native font scaling remains enabled; shared text does not set `allowFontScaling={false}` or cap the font-size multiplier. Turkish text is stored in localization files rather than token definitions.

Shape roles are `compact` 8, `control` 12, `card` 20, `sheet` 28, and `pill` 999. Border widths are `subtle` 1 and `strong` 2. The system does not define shadows or elevation because the current shell does not need them.

Interaction opacity is tokenized as `pressedOpacity` 0.72 and `disabledOpacity` 0.48. Presentation code uses these tokens rather than repeating the literal values.

`withAlpha(hexColor, alpha)` in `theme/color-alpha.ts` derives a translucent `rgba()` value from an already resolved semantic color. It is the only approved way to build a tinted surface, and it rejects anything other than a six-digit hex input. It never introduces a new hue: the input must be a semantic role read from the theme, never a brand primitive.

Motion durations are `immediate` 0 ms, `fast` 120 ms, `normal` 200 ms, and `deliberate` 320 ms. The theme provider reads `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()` and listens for `reduceMotionChanged`. With Reduce Motion enabled, all tokenized durations resolve to 0 and decorative entering animation is omitted. Content visibility and state never depend on animation.

## Theme resolution and access

`KuyaraThemeProvider` defaults to the `system` preference and resolves React Native's light, dark, null, and unspecified appearance states. The profile application provider now supplies the persisted `system | light | dark` value without changing token consumers.

Components read the typed theme with `useKuyaraTheme()`. Expo Router receives a matching React Navigation theme, the active semantic background is used across routes and tabs, and `expo-status-bar` selects light or dark content from the resolved appearance.

Use semantic meaning in presentation code:

```tsx
<Screen>
  <Surface>
    <AppText variant="title">...</AppText>
    <Button label={messages.action} onPress={handlePress} />
  </Surface>
</Screen>;
```

Do not import primitives or select a literal hue in feature code:

```tsx
// Incorrect: feature code couples itself to a palette value.
<View style={{ backgroundColor: brandColors.deepAtmosphere }} />
```

Static non-color scales may be imported for `StyleSheet.create` when that keeps shared styles stable. Theme-dependent colors remain on the resolved theme.

## Adaptive UI primitives

The canonical primitive entry point is `apps/mobile/src/components/ui/index.ts`. Primitives consume the theme on behalf of presentation code and provide narrow, typed defaults while still accepting the relevant React Native props and `style` escape hatch.

- `AppText` supports the existing `display`, `titleLarge`, `title`, `eyebrow`, `body`, `bodyStrong`, `caption`, `label`, and `code` typography roles plus typed semantic color roles. Font scaling is enabled by default, normal `Text` props are forwarded, and content is not truncated implicitly. At accessibility sizes it releases authored line heights so native text can grow without clipping. Feature compositions remain responsible for choosing a smaller semantic heading role when an oversized display treatment no longer fits.
- `Screen` is the shared Reanimated ScrollView page foundation used by checked-in routes. It applies the semantic application background, safe-area insets, page padding, and the current maximum content width while allowing feature screens to keep scroll events on the UI thread. A non-scrollable or keyboard-specific screen API is deferred until a checked-in flow requires it.
- `Surface` provides only `default`, `muted`, `elevated`, and `interactive` semantic variants. It uses semantic surface and border roles with the approved card radius; `elevated` denotes hierarchy without inventing a shadow token.
- `Button` provides `primary`, `secondary`, and `quiet` variants. The required visible `label` keeps localized text at the call site. Loading preserves label width, blocks activation, shows progress, and exposes busy and disabled accessibility state.
- `IconButton` requires an `accessibilityLabel` at the type boundary, accepts an optional standard accessibility hint through React Native props, owns the 44-point target, and receives icon content as a render function with the resolved semantic icon color. It does not select an icon system or glyph.
- `SectionHeader` composes a heading, optional supporting text, and optional trailing action. It changes to a stacked layout at large text sizes so the action does not compress the heading.
- `Pill` is a small non-interactive label capsule with `accent-filled` and `bordered` tones resolved by `resolvePillColors`. It owns its own compact label scale, which is a primitive-level decision rather than a feature one, and it stays non-interactive: a caller that needs a tap wraps it in its own pressable and supplies the accessibility role, state, and target.
- `PhotoPlaceholder` fills a fixed photo area with a striped semantic tint while no image is available. It renders its label only at heights of 96 points and above, because a thumbnail-sized box clips text at accessibility sizes; at smaller sizes it is a silent swatch and the surrounding row supplies the accessible name.
- `StretchyHeader` is a feature-independent absolute presentation primitive used by loaded Today and the ready Wardrobe list. It consumes a Reanimated shared vertical offset, measures safe-area-inclusive compact clearance, and stretches only its semantic `surface` background upward with a bottom-anchored transform. Pull distance and bottom-corner interpolation clamp at the current top inset; header content is never transformed. Scroll containers, feature state, localized content, navigation, refresh, and item rendering remain owned by each feature.

The checked-in Today feature is the first product composition over the primitives. Its route uses `Screen`, `AppText`, `Surface`, and `SectionHeader`; feature-specific weather and outfit components own their product semantics rather than widening the generic primitive API. The finalized primary tab bar is a navigation presentation component rather than a generic UI primitive. It uses the same semantic theme, minimum touch target, localized visible labels, a selection indicator, and selected accessibility state. Focused primitive tests preserve coverage for `Button` and `IconButton`.

Semantic tokens and primitives have different responsibilities. Tokens name visual roles and scales; primitives turn those roles into small accessibility and interaction contracts. Feature code remains responsible for localized content, layout composition, user intent, and domain-specific behavior. It may use raw React Native layout views where no semantic surface or control is intended.

Primitive APIs favor composition, a small variant union, and standard React Native props over arbitrary colors, numeric typography configuration, spacing props, or collections of styling booleans. New variants or primitives require a current product use rather than speculative completeness.

## Platform and accessibility policy

Kuyara identity colors are authored explicitly, so uncontrolled platform colors do not replace them. `PlatformColor` and `DynamicColorIOS` are not currently needed. If a future native control or system surface benefits materially from a platform color, the value must be centralized behind a semantic role with a cross-platform fallback rather than scattered through feature code.

The current provider represents system appearance and Reduce Motion. `AppText` preserves Dynamic Type behavior. Buttons expose button role, accessible name, disabled state, and busy state; icon-only buttons require a label; section titles expose heading semantics; interactive primitives use at least a 44-point target and a semantic focus ring. Labels can wrap, loading does not collapse button width, and control state is conveyed through accessibility metadata in addition to visual feedback. The stretchy header remains a modest, clamped, finger-tracked response under Reduce Motion and adds no autonomous timing, spring, parallax, or information-bearing transition.

Feature code selects a typography role and does not author its own `fontSize` or `lineHeight`. Overriding the role's line height silently defeats the natural-line-height release `AppText` performs at accessibility text sizes, so a fixed line height in a feature style clips text rather than growing it. A repository-wide assertion in `theme.test.mjs` fails the suite when a file under `features/` declares either property. Primitives under `components/ui/` are exempt, because a primitive that owns a compact scale is a system decision rather than a per-screen one.

The 44-point minimum is a target requirement, not a painted-size requirement. A control may present a smaller visual body and reach 44 points through `hitSlop`, as the Today header's settings button does with a 30-point circle and a 7-point slop. A control must not fall below 44 points of actual touch area by either route.

Press feedback is an immediate opacity or semantic-background change, not a decorative animation, so it remains responsive with Reduce Motion enabled. Existing collapsible content omits its fade when Reduce Motion is on. VoiceOver focus order follows source order: section heading, localized expand/collapse button, then expanded content. Accessibility hints are left to call sites and should only be supplied when the action result is not clear from its label.

## Implemented and deferred

Current implementation and milestone status is maintained in [`../current-status.md`](../current-status.md).

The milestone 4 generation-mode indicator reuses the existing `Pill` with a text label and existing tokens (`brandAccent` for AI-assisted, `borderSubtle` for standard), and the Settings probe loading animation drives `theme.motion` durations with a static Reduced-Motion path. No status token or status component was added, so state is never signalled by colour alone.

Deferred intentionally:

- Any migration from JavaScript Tabs to SDK 57's alpha Native Tabs
- Generic text-input, selector, switch, modal, or feedback frameworks; the Wardrobe controls remain feature-specific
- Divider, because the current shell has no repeated separator need
- A generic destructive button variant or new destructive color token; Wardrobe distinguishes removal through copy, section hierarchy, accessibility semantics, and the platform Alert style
- Non-scrollable and keyboard-specific screen behavior until a checked-in flow requires either
- Status tokens and status components
- Platform-color adapters until a concrete native integration needs them
- Shadows or elevation until a real hierarchy requires them
- Android visual refinement and emulator validation; shared React Native code remains build-compatible, but Android was not validated in this task

The four-tab information architecture is final. The current root uses a stable Expo Router Stack for the onboarding gate and Expo Router JavaScript Tabs for the main application. Native Tabs are not a drop-in implementation detail while the SDK 57 API remains alpha; any later migration must be reviewed explicitly. Android source compatibility is preserved, but Android build, emulator, and visual refinement remain unverified and deferred.
